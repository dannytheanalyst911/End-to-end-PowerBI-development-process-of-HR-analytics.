- We can see individual employee stats by selecting the name, as well as when they get hired, last and next date of review.
- For example, employee Estelle Chung has job satisfaction decreased by year, and in the last review, he stated himself as meeting expectations, but the manager thinks he needs improvement. The HR department needs to discuss with him what was happening and resolve the issue.

- Sales Representatives is the fastest-changing position with almost 40%, while Engineer Manager tends to stay within the company with only 2.7% attrition.
- Employees tend to hold on to their jobs at the beginning of the year and quit when Christmas comes, due to the attrition rate growing substantially from Q1 to Q4. Further investigations need to be done to find out why.
- Most of the employees(1043) are doing some business travel, and the one who goes on business trips frequently tends to quit more than others.
- People required to work overtime are likely to quit 3 times more than the ones who don't (30% vs 10%). Atlas may need to work on the company's overtime policy if it wants to fix this problem.
